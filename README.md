# PMS1 - Project Management System

A modern project management system built with TypeScript and Next.js, featuring email integration and invitation management capabilities.

## This is a Full-Stack TypeScript/Next.js application. Based on the repository structure visible (with files like drizzle.config.ts, next.config.mjs, and multiple TypeScript configuration files), this appears to be:

- Frontend: Next.js (React) with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js/TypeScript with likely API routes powered by Next.js API Routes
- Database: PostgreSQL (as indicated by Drizzle ORM configuration files)
- The presence of JavaScript files and shell/batch scripts suggests these are utility scripts and configuration files that support the main TypeScript application.

## 📋 Project Overview

- User invitation system
- Email integration
- Member management capabilities
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
